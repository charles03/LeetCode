 * LFU (Least Frequently Used) is a famous cache eviction algorithm.

 For a cache with capacity k, if the cache is full and need to evict a key in it,
 the key with the lease frequently used will be kicked out.

 Implement set and get method for LFU cache.

 Example
 Given capacity=3

 set(2,2)
 set(1,1)
 get(2)
 >> 2
 get(1)
 >> 1
 get(2)
 >> 2
 set(3,3)
 set(4,4)
 get(3)
 >> -1
 get(2)
 >> 2
 get(1)
 >> 1
 get(4)
 >> 4

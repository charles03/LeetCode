 This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
 Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

     * swap its children, and add the children to the queue. NULL nodes are not added to the queue.
     * Eventually the queue will be empty and all the children swapped. and we return the original root

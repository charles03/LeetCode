/**
 * Created by charles on 4/1/17.
 * Using Morris Traversal, we can traverse the tree without using stack and recursion.
 * The idea of Morris Traversal is based on Threaded Binary Tree. In this traversal,
 * we first create links to Inorder successor and print the data using these links, and finally revert the changes to restore original tree.
 *
 * 1. Initialize current as root
    2. While current is not NULL
        If current does not have left child
            a) Print currentâ€™s data
            b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
        Else
            a) Make current as right child of the rightmost
                node in current's left subtree
            b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left

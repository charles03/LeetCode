/**
 * Created by charles on 5/18/17.
 * Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ N) in this array:

 The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
 i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
 Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

 Example 1:
 Input: 2
 Output: 2
 Explanation:

 The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

 Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

 Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

 The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

 Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

 Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
 Note:
 N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.

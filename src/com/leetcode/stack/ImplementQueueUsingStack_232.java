/**
 * Created by charles on 2/27/17.
 * Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

 push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
 pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
 peek() -- Get the front element.
 empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
 Notes:
 You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
 Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
 You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

     * Why this is Amortized O(1)
     * Amortized analysis give the average performance (over time) of each operation in the worst case
     * the basic idea is that a worst case operation can alter the state in such a way that worst case
     * cannot occur again for a long time, thus amortizing its cost
     *
     * Although a single pop operation could be expensive, it is expensive only once per n times (queue size),
     * when s2 is empty and there is a need for data transfer between s1 and s2. Hence the total time complexity of the sequence is : n (for push operations) + 2*n (for first pop operation) + n - 1 ( for pop operations) which is O(2*n)O(2âˆ—n).This gives O(2n/2n)O(2n/2n) = O(1)O(1) average time per operation.

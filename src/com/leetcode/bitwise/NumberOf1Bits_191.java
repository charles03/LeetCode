/**
 * Created by charles on 2/8/17.
 * Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

 For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

     * while n != 0 instead of n > 0 is because int n in java is signed
     * Let's use n = 00101100 as an example. This binary representation has three 1s.

     If n = 00101100, then n - 1 = 00101011, so n & (n - 1) = 00101100 & 00101011 = 00101000. Count = 1.

     If n = 00101000, then n - 1 = 00100111, so n & (n - 1) = 00101000 & 00100111 = 00100000. Count = 2.

     If n = 00100000, then n - 1 = 00011111, so n & (n - 1) = 00100000 & 00011111 = 00000000. Count = 3.

     n is now zero, so the while loop ends, and the final count (the numbers of set bits) is returned.
